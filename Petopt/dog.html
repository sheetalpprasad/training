<p style="padding-left: 40px;margin-right:10px; text-align:justify;">– There are more than 150 dog breeds, divided into 8 classes: sporting, hound, working, terrier, toy, non-sporting, herding, and miscellaneous.
<br />
– According to a recent survey, the most popular name for a dog is Max. Other popular names include Molly, Sam, Zach, and Maggie.
<br />
– Dogs can vary in size from a 36 inch (150+ lb.) Great Dane to a 2 lb. Chihuahua.
<br />
– Puppies and kittens can be adopted as early as 8 weeks of age. Until then, they should stay with their moms and littermates.
<br />
– About 1/3 of the dogs that are surrendered to animal shelters are purebred dogs.
<br />
– Contrary to popular belief, dogs do not sweat by salivating. They sweat through the pads of their feet.
<br />
– Dogs may not have as many taste buds as we do (they have about 1,700 on their tongues, while we humans have about 9,000), but that doesn’t mean they’re not discriminating eaters. They have over 200 million scent receptors in their noses (we have only 5 million) so it’s important that their food smells good and tastes good.
<br />
– The term “dog days” has nothing to do with dogs. It dates back to Roman times, when it was believed that Sirius, the Dog Star, added its heat to that of the sun from July 3 to August 11, creating exceptionally high temperatures."</p>

<br>
<br>
Walking the dog is not aerobic exercise. It’s a meander. We stop periodically so the dog can read the latest smells with his long, elegant collie nose. We walk to the park or the bakery or just around the neighborhood. The dog is amenable to all of these destinations. He’s outside. I’m on the other end of the leash. Life is good.







I could say I got the dog for exercise or to get myself out of the house or to have an excuse for my husband and me to make up silly songs, the way we did when our kids—all grown up now—were too young to roll their eyes at us.

<br>
<br>
Bathing your feisty dog can be an uphill task, especially each time it puts up a fight resisting the event. Also did you know that there are certain steps that need to be observed to offer the right bathing experience to your pet dog? You definitely don’t want your dog to develop complete aversion towards bath. Bathing the dog comes with its own set of advantages such as ridding the hair of filth/mud & stink and the chances of suffering from a tick and flea attack are greatly reduced in a clean coat. On the contrary your pet covered in dirt may feel at its handsome best!</p>

<p style=" text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;"><span style="font-size:36px">Feed the dog</span>
<br>
<br>
It’s important to remember all dogs are individuals, and what diet might be fine for your friend’s dog may be completely inappropriate for your dog. When it comes to a daily diet for your dog, it’s important to consult with your vet.
Domesticated dogs are largely carnivores that eat some omnivorous foods.1 Dr Leigh from Your Vet Online advises that it is important to ensure your dog’s food is both complete and balanced for its stage of life, and if it has any medical issues.
It is entirely acceptable to feed your dog a pure kibble diet. Or you can mix their diet up with some cooked or raw meat, fish, vegetables and rice..</p>
