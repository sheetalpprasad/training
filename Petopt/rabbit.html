Rabbits are very active and playful animals that are also very social.They will form a close bond with other rabbits and even with people. As long as you know what to expect from a pet rabbit, they have the potential to be wonderful pets. The ideal owner for a pet rabbit is an individual or family with the time and space to dedicate to an active pet that enjoys cuddling and playing and requires a bit of maintenance. Whether it involves daily interaction with owners or other rabbits, these animals require a lot of interaction. Rabbits come in many different breeds—lionhead, mini lop, mini rex, rex, lop, Dutch, English spot, and hotot, to name a few—and some can even be raised as show animals.

	<h1>Benefits of Adopting a Rabbit</h1>

		Continually overrun with abandoned rabbits, local shelters and rescues are the best place to find a new pet bunny. Not only will you save an animal from possible euthanasia, there are also several additional benefits.
			</p><br>
			<p>
Aside from the ability to choose from a wide selection of different kinds of rabbits, adopting from a shelter or rescue is also very convenient. Volunteers at rescues take the time to acclimate rabbits to living in apartments and houses. In this way, the time you would have to take to train the rabbit is cut down considerably.In addition to saving a lot of time and effort, adopting a rabbit from a rescue also saves you money on vet bills. Rabbit rescues usually have partnerships with local vets, and rabbits will be spayed or neutered upon reaching sexual maturity. So you can adopt a rabbit after he or she has recovered from the surgery and not have to worry about paying for the procedure.
			</p><br>
			<p>Moreover, some rabbits suffer from health conditions of varying severity. One common affliction is malocclusion, a condition where the rabbit’s teeth are not aligned properly and the rabbit is unable to wear down his/her teeth.When you adopt from a rescue, all the rabbits will be checked for malocclusion as well as other afflictions. They will then be properly treated.If the rabbit has an chronic health issue, the rescue will alert potential new parents of the condition, so only those willing and able to care for the bunny can adopt him/her. If you purchase a rabbit from a breeder or pet store, they may not alert you to any pre-existing health problems.
Rabbits can live up to 12 years or longer when you properly care for them. This is a major point of attraction for people who are looking for non-cat or non-dog pet, other small animals like rats and hamsters don’t live as long as rabbits.

			First thing first.Before getting a bunny in your home, you must have ready the habitat. You might keep your bunny in a small wire cage initially until the completion of their dwelling place.You can keep your bunny in the indoor habitat or Outdoor habitat. If you want to keep your bunny in outdoor habitat, you could buy a large outdoor rabbit hutch or you could make a DIY large hutch. When you are not in your home you could keep them in the outside hutch. When you are available, you could free them. But I like to keep my bunny in the indoor cage. If you have enough space in your house, you could use an indoor rabbit cage.

			 Provide unlimited hay to your bunny when she or he starts eating hay. Hay is the leading food for the adult bunny. You could provide alfalfa hay to the baby rabbit.Provide quality rabbit pellets. Clean water is a much-needed item for the bunny. Don’t give dirty water. It will be the cause of the illness of your beloved bunny.You could offer rabbit-safe fresh vegetables twice or thrice a week. For an adult bunny, 1-2 cups of vegetables are enough. Carrots are favorite to rabbits. But don’t provide it for a lot at a time. Consumption of a lot of carrots is toxic for the rabbit.You could provide some fresh fruit like bananas, apples, pineapples, watermelon, and other seasonal fruits to your bunny. Fruits contain high sugar. So, give seasonal fruit as treat to your bunny.
