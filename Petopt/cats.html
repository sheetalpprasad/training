Hundreds of cats including are abandoned and rescued in India everyday. Although there are many wonderful souls across the nation who work extra hours and put in efforts beyond their capacity, there is always a shortage of funding and communication across the animal activist circuit.
Keeping this issue in mind, we have launched the Adoption section at DogSpot.in. This pan-India online portal aims to establish a database of pet animals cats that are available in many cities and others across the country. We are here to not just display these pets but assist in the process by having a streamlined process in place which includes filling up of the adoption form as well as mediating between the two parties, namely the current foster/shelter of the pet and the potential adopting entity.
Our ultimate goal is reduce cats over-population by providing loving homes for all the homeless cats, and at the same time helping every human share their lives with a furry companion that they so dearly want.

	<center><h1>There are many types of cats, let me name a few for you!</h1></center><br>
	
<ul>
<li style="padding-left:1%;"><b>-Abyssinian</b>:The Abyssinian, also referred to as the Aby, is a lively and active cat. Many Abyssinians even love water,and most will spend their days climbing and exploring</li>
<li style="padding-left:1%;"><b>-Exotic</b>:The exotic has been dubbed “the lazy man’s Persian” because it’s similar to the Persian cat in its sweet looks but has a coat that requires much less maintenance</li>
<li style="padding-left:1%;"><b>-Maine Coon</b>:Contrary to folklore, the Maine coon isn't the result of a cat breeding with a raccoon. It's most likely a cross between an American domestic cat and a longhaired foreign cat.</li>
<li style="padding-left:1%;"><b>-British Shorthair</b>:The British shorthair is considered to be the oldest natural cat breed from England. While moderately active, British shorthairs are ideal household cats and can be comfortable with children and other pets</li>
<li style="padding-left:1%;"><b>-Persian</b>:With their flowing coat, sweet face, and affectionate disposition, it’s no wonder Persians are one of the most popular cat breeds</li>
<li style="padding-left:1%;"><b>-Ragdoll</b>:Ragdoll cats got their name because of their tendency to relax and go limp in a person’s arms. These cats adore their humans and will follow them from room to room</li>
<li style="padding-left:1%;"><b>-American Shorthair</b>:The American shorthair, the pedigreed version of the domestic shorthair, is a fairly low-maintenance pet.</li>

			Cats are among the cleanest animals there are out there. And among other pets, they are undoubtedly the most hygienic. They continually lick and clean themselves after doing their needs, coming back from the garden, playing, and even after being touched by a person.They won’t give you any cleaning work. They will take care of it themselves! But you must comply with treatments to eliminate fleas and ticks.
			</p><br>
			<p>
Although it is often said that cats are independent and aloof, the truth is that they also express their affection in many ways and love to be pampered. The relationship we have with our kitten is authentic, intense, and deep. Don’t forget that cats establish certain connections with their owners (or at least one of their family members), both emotionally and spiritually. If a cat chooses you, then you will be their favorite persons.
			</p><br>
			<p>
			Although puppies can be a little naughty, cats tend to spend a lot of time sleeping, and when they wake up, they are usually very discreet. They can walk around us without realizing it. This is due to their pads under their paws.They only meow when they are hungry or bored. But they won’t make noise at any other time of day.
Unlike dogs, you don’t need to take them for a walk to do their chores, as cats just need a clean litter box to do in it. This is perfect if you are away from home for many hours or don’t have time to walk your pet. Once he learns how to use the sandbox, he won’t need anything else. This can be a benefit or a disadvantage. However, cat autonomy is welcome for people who travel a lot or work more than 8 hours a day. You can go out in the morning and come back at night and even getaway on the weekend without worrying about your cat. All he needs is a plate full of food, another full of water, and his litter box clean.

			 Most cats will prefer the litter box to other parts of the house because of the texture of the litter.But, there are still steps you need to take to make sure you're offering the litter box as the best place to use the bathroom. Keep in mind that kittens and older cats with arthritis or other health problems may have problems getting in and out of a box that's too tall. Use low-height boxes in an easily accessible area for kittens and cats with special needs, or buy an adjustable litter box.Cats are curious, and will jump on counters or other places you'd like them to steer clear of.

			 Cat food comes in a vast array of types: dry food, semi-moist, and canned are the common types. Dry food is easily and efficiently stored, but cats go wild for the taste of semi-moist and canned foods. The latter types can add more fluid to the cat’s diet than dry foods. In general, food type comes down to owner preference.Like other animals, cats have some specific nutritional needs. They are "obligate carnivores," which means they need animal proteins to avoid severe health consequences.[9] Ask your vet for suggestions about a good quality food. Cheaper products may not provide enough nutrition to keep your cat happy and healthy.

			 You may think that because cats seem to groom themselves, you don't need to brush them. But you do need to brush long-hair cats several times a week and short-hair cats weekly. This will help reduce shedding in your home and also help the cat avoid the dreaded hairballs.Be on the lookout for any fleas or other parasites, and for any unusual redness, lumps, bumps, or other skin problems. If you see anything suspicious, let your veterinarian know and ask for advice on how you should take care of it. Make sure to check the under belly of a cat with your hands.

			Kittens are adorably tempting, but be honest with yourself about whether you'll be able to match that energy level, and handle that level of responsibility. Shelters are full of loving adult cats who have a much harder time getting adopted. An adult cat will be calmer and quieter than a kitten, but may also have behavioral issues from its early life. Adult cats may also have medical conditions you'll have to address sooner than you would with a kitten. Also, kittens often scratch very painfully; Decide if you want that.
