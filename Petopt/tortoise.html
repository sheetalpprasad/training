<p style="padding-left: 40px;margin-right:10px; text-align:justify;">–It’s a little hard to believe, but it’s true that tortoises have been roaming Earth for over 55 million years.
<br />
– It isn’t common to see a creep because tortoises are solitary animals that roam around a lot. Some mothers are protective of their nests, though, so you can occasionally spot a creep if she decides to stick around. Still, she doesn’t tend to her young once they hatch.
<br />
– Even in the wild, healthy tortoises can live up to 150 years. There are a rare few that even lived longer than 200 years.
<br />
– Each bone in a tortoise’s shell is connected to one another. It doesn’t look like it, but they are also able to feel when their shells are touches because of the nerve endings in them.
<br />
– Okay, maybe you already knew this, but for moving at only 0.2 miles per hour, they somehow travel up to 4 miles every day.
<br />
– Weather doesn’t only play a role in their sex, but also the colors of their shells. Tortoises found in hot, desert climates have lighter colored shells to reflect light, and cooler climates produce darker colors that absorb more heat.
<br />
–You would think that being so closely related to turtles would help you be a master swimmer, but tortoises cannot swim. They can, however, hold their breath for up to half an hour.
<br />
– A lot of reptiles, include tortoises, use their throats to smell instead of their noses. They have a vomeronasal organ on the roof of their mouths and pump air through the nose and around the mouth to use it."</p>

<br>
Before you even buy a tortoise, be sure to select a right kind of enclosure. Many people use glass aquariums, which are actually not a very good for your pet. It is because the sides are too high for him and not much floor space for them.Instead, you can opt for more wider as well as a shallower container for them. Even a large plastic storage container works for them in an indoor habitat. You can even buy large wooden tortoise table for enough floor space.Tortoises are an exciting pet, and are very fun as well as fun to watch and care for. However, since they have been around for a really long time, they have developed few preferences, which are needed for there personal care as well as there needs. This also means that caring for a tortoise is quite a bigger commitment than you think, and it takes many times as well as dedication to be sure that your tortoise is healthy and strong.

You must let your tortoise out in the sun to bask some natural sunlight is a pretty good idea, if there is no source of getting a natural sunlight, then you can even use a UV lamp to provide this artificial sunlight.Depending on the species, the amount of UV provided also varies. But, mostly it varies between eight to twelve hours.</p>
